Graduated from [EFREI Paris](https://eng.efrei.fr/) and [Universit√© de Sherbrooke](https://www.usherbrooke.ca/about/), I work as a consultant at [Alten](https://www.alten.com/) for [Thales](https://www.thalesgroup.com/en). I am open to new opportunities as a Data Scientist. My main skills are Python developement and scripting, data processing and machine learning.

I am passionate about computer science and, more specifically, artificial intelligence. Curious, independent, and persistent, I enjoy deepening my knowledge in this field. I am an amateur cyclist and I play chess competitively. I also like solving puzzles and reading and watching thrillers.
